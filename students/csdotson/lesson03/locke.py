small_locke = Locke(5)
large_locke = Locke(10)

### Case 1: A lock with sufficient capacity can move boats without incident.
print('*Test 1* - Sufficient Capacity')
with large_locke as locke:
    locke.move_boats_through(boats)

### Case 2: Too many boats through a small locke will raise an exception
