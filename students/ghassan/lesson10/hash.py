The armies approach each other, but before they meet, Paris offers to end the war by fighting a duel with Menelaus, 
urged by his brother and head of the Trojan army, Hector. 
While Helen tells Priam about the Greek commanders from the walls of Troy, 
both sides swear a truce and promise to abide by the outcome of the duel. Paris is beaten, 
but Aphrodite rescues him and leads him to bed with Helen before Menelaus can kill him.
